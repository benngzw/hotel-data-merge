# Hotels Data Merge Service

## Description

The Hotels Data Merge Service is a ExpressJS application that aggregates hotel data from various suppliers and make them available via a RESTful API.

## Installation

```sh
npm install
```

## Running locally

A sample `.env` file has been included in this repo as `.env-local`.
Rename it to `.env` for the environment variables to be loaded correctly.

There are two ways to run it locally.

### Running only MongoDB with Docker

Use this way of running when doing development because we will not need to build the docker image everytime there is a change.

Make sure you have docker installed in your local environment. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) would be a great way to do it.

Pull the MongoDB image from the docker repo
```sh
docker pull mongo
```

Start up a MongoDB container
```sh
npm run mongo:up
```

To shut down the MongoDB container
```sh
npm run mongo:down
```

Run the web application locally
```sh
npm run dev
```

### Running locally purely with Docker

Use this way when development is done and we want to test the web application docker image. 

Build the web application image. 
```sh
npm run docker:build
```

Start up MongoDB and ExpressJS app containers
```sh
npm run docker:up
```

To shutdown MongoDB and ExpressJS app containers
```sh
npm run docker:down
```

## Running tests
Execute tests via jest
```sh
npm run test
```

## API Endpoints

### GET /hotels

Fetches a list of hotels based on query parameters.

#### Request

- **URL**: `/hotels`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `destination` (optional): The destination ID to filter hotels by.
  - `hotels` (optional): A comma-separated list of hotel IDs to filter by.

Sample Curl Command
```sh
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/hotels?destination={DESTINATION_ID}&hotels={HOTEL1_ID},{HOTEL2_ID}"
``` 

#### Response

‚ùï The `amenities` field was modified to not split into `general` and `room` categories. 

The consideration to do so is because 2 out of 3 current suppliers provide a generalised list of amenities, which combines both general and room amenities. Since there is no easy way to categorise them, the current decision would be to combine them in one list.

**Success**:
